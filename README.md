### üéì Lab 10 ‚Äì Jackson Schmidt

# Final-Lab-Project

**Displaying short answer and algorithm responses dynamically with formatting.**

---

> *‚ÄúEnjoy my heavily over-engineered Lab 10 Assignment that I'm pretty sure you can get a 100 on without writing any code, haha.‚Äù*

This project demonstrates:
- Class-based design (encapsulation, dynamic method calls)
- Dictionary-based storage and retrieval
- Clean terminal UI formatting (typing effect, line-by-line output)
- Separation of logic by header/question/answer display

---

### üìÅ Files
- `main.py` ‚Äî core script for timed question/answer display
- `README.md` ‚Äî this file you're reading
- No external dependencies required (standard Python libraries)
### üé¨ Demo

![Demo of Lab 10 Script](demo.gif)

### üîß How to Run
```bash
